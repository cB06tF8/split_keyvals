# split_keyvals
Rust library for splitting keyvalue pairs

## Other Information
This app was a learning exercise for me and is very simple. It has the capacity to split string=string and string=u32 keyvalue pairs, 
returning each value in a struct<T1, T2> format. There are probably better existing and mature solutions for what I needed, but it
was just an exercise and accomplished what I needed.
